### You really shouldn't run this program. It has quite a few memory leaks at the moment.

A terminal-based 3d rendering engine. Uses ANSI escape codes to color the text.

This only works on Linux.

You must either be a part of the `input` group or run the program with `sudo` for keyboard controls to work.

You can make yourself part of the `input` group like this:

`sudo usermod -a -G input $USER`

After you make yourself part of the `input` group, reboot before running the program.
